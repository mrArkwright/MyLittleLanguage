# My Little Language

This is a little programming language that I am developing to learn about developing programming languages and writing compilers. I'm roughly following the tutorial on [stephendiehl.com/llvm](http://www.stephendiehl.com/llvm).

A code example demonstrating the current state of the language lives in [test/example.mll](test/example.mll).
